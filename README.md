# blockchain-node-script-hyperledger-fabric
blockchain node script using the Hyperledger Fabric framework in Rust

This script initializes a client object using the default configuration files, loads a user identity from a file, creates a channel object and loads the channel configuration, installs and instantiates a chaincode on the channel, invokes a transaction on the chaincode, and queries the chaincode for a key-value pair. Note that this script assumes that the Fabric network and chaincode are already set up and running, and that the necessary configuration files, channel artifacts, and chaincode files are available on the local filesystem.
